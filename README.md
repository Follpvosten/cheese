# Minetest Cheese Mod (WIP)
This mod adds various stupid cheese items that physically and logically make no sense.
They are usually as strong and durable as steel tools, and as fast as mese/diamond tools.

Slay monsters with your cheese sword, protected by your cheese armor, while eating
some cheese to regain health.

Depends on default to be able to register cheese ores.

## Optional dependencies
* petz, mobs_animal: If available, item aliases will be added to integrate

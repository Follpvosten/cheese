# Minetest Cheese Mod (WIP)
This mod adds various stupid cheese items that physically and logically make no sense.

Slay monsters with your cheese sword, protected by your cheese armor, while eating
some cheese to regain health.

Depends on default to be able to register cheese ores.

## Optional dependencies
* petz: If petz is active, the default cheese item is the one from petz
